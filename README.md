# hello-world
This is my first repository in GitHub.
My name is Basem and I am really interested in learning programing.
I am a graduate student in Geophysics, So programing is a powerfull skill that will help me a lot in my research work.
I am currently investigating the crustal deformation in Afar trible Junction and sourrounding areas.
I am trying to integrate Earthquake seismology, Space Geodesey techniques to measure the crustal deformation in one of the most important tectonic regions on the earth. 
I belive that being a member of GitHub comunity will be very helpfull for me to learn and improve my programming skills to solve challenging problems.
